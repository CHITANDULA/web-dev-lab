                                            Description of the Lab
This lab involved setting up a web development environment by installing VS Code, Git, and Node.js. I created a basic HTML file and opened it in a web browser. Additionally, I configured Git, initialized a repository, and pushed the project to GitHub. The lab also included working with branches, making commits, and collaborating through pull requests.
